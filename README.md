# Dog Breed Classifier

This is my submission for the Udacity ***Dog Breed Classification*** 🐶 project. The project detects the breed of the dog 🐕 in the image given by the user. It also detects humans 💀 if the image contains a human. My submission for the project is the `dog_app.ipynb` and `report.html` files.

Below is the list of tasks I plan to do in the near future.

## To Do -

- [ ] Clean the project structure and files.
- [ ] Deploy to an endpoint url.
- [ ] Use more models for the same task.
